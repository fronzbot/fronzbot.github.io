# **PROFESSIONAL**

-----

**Sr. Mixed Signal IC Design Engineer** <span style="color: gray">at</span> **Synaptics Inc** <span style="color: gray">in</span> Rochester, NY <span style="color: gray">from</span> Feb 2014 to Present
<br>

### Fingerprint Sensing
- Designed a small area, noise-optimized current-mode front-end which helped reduce die cost by nearly 50%
- Designed an innovative multi-level mixing topology to improve SNR
- Drove circuit and system implementation of a small area current-mode front-end in order to prove ability of the new technology to sense a fingerprint (stepping-stone for fingerprint sensor cost reduction)
- Led efforts to evaluate, track, and debug new silicon for any potential issues that could require a metal or all-layer revision, allowing for efficient evaluation of benefits/risks of a potential spin
- Designed a capacitive background cancellation circuit with sub-femtofarad resolution

### Touch Sensing
- Designed a small-area current-mode baseline correction circuit for TDDI (Touch and Display Driver IC) in order to reduce die cost and maintain competitive edge in TDDI market
- Designed switched capacitor demodulator and sample-and-hold circuitry for TDDI analog front-ends

### Low Power and Reference Circuits
- Architected and led the implementation of an experimental small area, nano-Amp reference architecture (current mirrors, oscillators, etc) with the goal of reducing standby power without sacrificing performance
- Designed a sub 1-V bandgap reference with innovative base-cancellation circuit for TDDI chips
- Aided in development of a top-level mixed-signal verification flow for capacitive fingerprint sensors, allowing teams to efficiently catch system-level bugs before tapeout

### Display Drivers
- Experience with MIPI DSI from transistor-level design through top-level verification and production test
- Experience designing high-voltage gate-line drivers

### General
- Experience working closely and effectively with multidisciplinary teams to ensure smooth silicon design and bring-up all the way through to production
- Have designed circuits in 130nm and 55nm technologies
- Very familiar and comfortable with Cadence design flow for IC design
- Experience using MATLAB for both system design and for testing of ASICs
- Focus on fundamental understanding of circuits for architectural comparisons is a strength (i.e. pencil-and-paper analysis)
- Attended a week-long Continuous-Time Delta Sigma Converter course held by MEAD (taught by Drs. Pavan, Schreier, and Hanumolu).

**Silicon Validation Contractor** <span style="color: gray">at</span> **Synaptics Inc** <span style="color: gray">in</span> Rochester, NY <span style="color: gray">from</span> Jun 2013 to Feb 2014
<br>
- Performed extensive validation on LDOs, VCOM drivers, LCD level shifters, and high-speed MIPI D-PHY architecture

**Analog Design Co-op** <span style="color: gray">at</span> **Intel Corporation** <span style="color: gray">in</span> Hudson, MA <span style="color: gray">from</span> Mar 2012 to Aug 2012
<br>
- Implemented a tool to extract on-chip decoupling capacitors to minimize off-chip capacitor size
- Implemented a tool to rapidly compare pad layout revisions to minimize errors due to manual inspection

# **EDUCATION**

-----

**Rochester Institute of Technology** <span style="color: gray">in</span> Rochester, NY <span style="color: gray">from</span> Sep 2008 to Aug 2013
<br>
**Master of Science** and Bachelor of Science in **Electrical Engineering** <span style="color: gray">with a graduate</span> GPA <span style="color: gray">of</span> 4.0

Thesis: ***Stability Analysis of Switched DC-DC Boost Converters for Integrated Circuits***
- Investigated small-signal modeling and stability requirements for boost converters, as well as a variety of OTA-based controller topologies, in order to aid in the design and measurement of boost converter stability on an ASIC.  Also investigated use of genetic algorithms as a way to optimize controller design.
